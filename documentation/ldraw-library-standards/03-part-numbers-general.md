# Part Numbering

## Introduction
 
This section outlines the LDraw part numbering schema for the Offficial Library.  While the goal is to be comprehensive, it may not outline all situations involving the numbering of parts for the Official Library. As these rules have evolved over time, there may be part in the Official Library that do not conform. This legacy numbering remains in place for backwards compatibility reasons. 

## General Part Numbering

### Known Part Numbers

> If the part number (Design ID) used by LEGO is known, then that number shall be used.

#### Where to Find Part Numbers

For modern parts, these numbers are often moulded in a discreet place on the part.  These are typically four digit numbers in the range 2001-9999, or five-digit numbers. Don't be confused by a number of the form *n-nn* (eg. 4-01), or even single numbers or letters on older parts - these are probably something to do with identifying individual moulds and are not the part number.  

#### Part Numbers vs. Element IDs

The numbers listed next to parts at the back of instruction manuals are not the part numbers (also called Design IDs) LDraw.org uses as its nomenclature, but the Element IDs or Item IDs, a number that signifies both the part shape and color. Since LDraw parts can be any color, LDraw does not use Element IDs but solely Design IDs. 

For example: a Brick 1x2's Design ID is "3004" while a Tan Brick 1x2's Element ID is "4109995". Hence you will not find 4109995 in the LDraw parts library.

### Unknown Part Numbers

> If LEGO part number is not known, a number with the format uNNNN.dat will be used

This number will be reserved by the author via the library website prior to submitting the part to the Parts Tracker. The part will retain the u-prefixed  number as long as the part's true number is unknown. If the LEGO part number is identified during the review process, then the part will renumbered and the u-prefixed number will become available for re-use.

Prior to 2010, a three-digit part number was used. That range of numbers, however, was exhausted. During development, and for posting to the Parts Tracker, the three-digit number was preceded with an "x" (e.g. x123.dat), and upon inclusion in an official release, the "x" was removed. This process is no longer used.

### Mould Variants/Different Versions or Parts with the Same Number

> If the mould variants of a part have different numbers, the different LEGO (design ID) numbers will be used. 

> If the different variations will have the same number, a single alpha character to the end of the base part number 

For example:  e.g. 3626a.dat and 3626b.dat, the solid stud and hollow stud versions of the minifig head). 

If, prior to the second version being authored, one version of the part was released using just the official part number (no alpha-character suffix), it will be renumbered/moved to use an alpha-suffix. 

> Separate uNNNN numbers will be used for each variant of a part with an unknown number.

### Obsolete Parts

Occaisonally a part is included with geometry that is not quite correct or the part number itself is incorrect. 

> In order to preserve backward compatability, when a corrected part is made, it's part number will follow the part varient number rules and the non-alpha suffix part will be made obsolete.

### Parts on Sprues or Runners

Some small parts are delivered from LEGO still connected to a sprue (or runner) containing several different parts (e.g. the castle feathers or the coins). 

> Parts on sprues or runners will follow the part varient number rules

## Special numbering cases

Some classes of parts (e.g. patterns, stickers, subparts, and primitives) have additional numbering rules. Those rules will be defined in the respective sections for those classes of parts.
